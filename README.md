# Trajectory-Planning-of-Turtlbot3-in-ROS

This Program Controls the turtlebot3 robot in ROS to a desired trajecorty using a constant forward velocity and the yaw rate dpending on the orthogonal distance from the desred trajectory

The trajectory the robot will follow is a line generated in the program
